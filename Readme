Example 1:  Example of looping over the lines in a file (In are case a bunch of mfc setpoints) 
Example 2:  Extension for Example 1, create a file called varables_A.txt. The input file is then read.  The "Value" is then set to a global
Varable.  write_variable_A is called which takes 100 samples of the input varable and appends it to the file varables_A.txt.
Input:
200
400
600
800
1000
700
350
150
0

So the first value would be 1,200 second would be 2,200 etc
1 , 200

2 , 200

3 , 200
Until......
900 , 0
Once the file is complete the Config_plot Keyword is performed and the Test.png file is created...
